User has been playing the same games for a couple weeks now and is getting bored. After having completed all the levels they decide that
they want to play something new. However, all the new games they try arenâ€™t exactly their style, but the user isn't sure where to find games 
they might like. They decide to try our game ranker to see if it might help.

The user should login using their email address and a password of their choice in order to access their account (make a new account if new user)

Once logged in, the user will input a game they've enjoyed or want to play. 

Based on the game the user has inputed, the app will find data on the game and find games that are similar and complie them into a list.

Once the lists are compiled, the ranker will rank them.
