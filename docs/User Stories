are not as fufilling as they used to be. No matter what games you try to play, none of them are really your style, and you realize that you don't
have a good wayto find the kind of games that you enjoy playing. Luckily for you, there Game Ranker!

Our user will be able to login using their email address and a password of their choice in order to access/create an account. 
Once logged in, the user will have the option to input a game that they have enjoyed playing in the past. 
Our Game Ranker program will then use the name of the game to curate a small list of 3 options that the user can consider playing that alligns with 
their interest. This list is organized by comparing the user-inputted game's genre with other games in the RawG database and outputting games that have 
similar, if not identitical genre categories as the inputted game. 
Meanwhile you wait, we offer a selection of soft gaming music by C418 through the utilization of Spotify in order to provide a warm and comfortable
ambience to our program.
The list hasthe potential of being different everytime, as our system offers games both old and new, some that are very popular, and others that may 
have never been heard of. Thus, our Game Ranker will alway provide fresh and interesting game options for the user to consider enjoying themselves!
