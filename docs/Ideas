Game Ranker: 
Games are a fun way to interact with friends online, but when you don’t know what games to play, 
or games have gotten too boring, that can be a little hard. Luckily with our Game Ranker, given a set of games 
that a user ranks by interest and as well as a ranked set of games they’ve played, this program uses a database 
of games to suggest games the user has not played yet that they might enjoy in the form of a ranking system. 
The rankings of each game  will be based on several categories: game genre, company, price, game rating, etc. 
Using these categories, our program will compile a list of games and rank them based on both the categories of 
games the user has played as well as the categories of games the user has demonstrated interest in. Accounts 
can be made so that these rankings can be shared with friends.

T Express Detector: 
Ever wait for the T only to have it just zoom past you because it's an express? Worry no more! 
This software would check to see if the T arriving is an express or not, updating real time based on the data it 
pulls from the MBTA. So even if the T changes to an express on the way (which does happen!) this software would 
tell you immediately so that you don’t have to waste your precious time to wait for a T that has no plans on 
letting you on. This software would take user input on their location as well as their destination to suggest if 
the user should take the train that is arriving in order to allow them to get to their destination using the T as 
quickly and as efficiently as possible.
